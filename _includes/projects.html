    <h3> 2019 Codebase </h3>
    <p>After months of experimentation and three complete rewrites of our base code, we have built a strong base for this year's robot. This year, efficiency is key. Our code runs as fast as possible to give our drivers the most flexibility we can provide.</p>

    <h3> rrLib </h3>
    <p>Throughout the 2019 season, we have been fully rewriting and restructuring our codebases to be more efficient and make better use of our resources. Many changes allowed us to build game-independent, reusable classes and functions. These have been collected into a library that allows us to easily write complex code with minimal effort.</p>
