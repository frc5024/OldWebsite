    <h3> BareBonesFRC </h3>
    <p>BareBonesFRC is a fork of our 2018 codebase that is designed to help kickstart the programming process for FRC teams each year. It is based off of cutting edge tools from the <a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/">Wpilib Team</a> and FRC. It was officially the first public project to use the new 2019 buildsystem and toolset.</p>
