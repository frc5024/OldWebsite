  <h1> BarebonesFRC </h1>
  <p> BarebonesFRC is a project that was started by a few members of the team as a simple, modular codebase that could be used to help teams get their robots moving as soon as possible. The idea was: "The faster that the easy stuff gets done, the more time can be spent on new features and bugfixes". Since the time that this project was started, BarebonesFRC has become the base of all our team's projects. Along with being an easy to set up codebase, it is also used by us to teach new members how to program robots. </p>
