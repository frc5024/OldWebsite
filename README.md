# Programming Team Website
This website is built with Jekyll and automatically deployed by github every time a commit is made to master.

## Editing
Most of the site is configured via variables in `_config.json`. To make a change, edit the appropriate section there.

To add, remove, or edit a robot, make or modify a file in the `_robots` directory. Just copy one of the other robot's configs to your new file and edit the values.
