## Robot features

Darth raider is a high-scoring robot designed to quickly get around the field. Three cameras are used for aiming, and a collection of drivebase sensors are used to localize the robot at all times. This allows darth raider to run real-time autonomous paths, and respond to it's environment. All actions are fully automated to let the drivers focus on scoring, not small tasks like sorting balls.
